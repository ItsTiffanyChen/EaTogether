          <p>Hello again! How did you feel chatting with John and Mary? Did you feel <span>heard</span>? <span>Ignored</span>? What was the experience like?</p>
          <p>We kind of do know your answer already. You probably are <span>not extremely happy</span> right now, because John and Mary <span>were not listening to you at all</span>. Well, let’s not blame them because <span>there was a reason why</span> they acted in such a way.</p>
          <p>Nowadays, with easy access to digital devices and other distractions, people are <span>forgetting their surroundings</span>. We have the tendency to jump from one thing to another and not be <span>present at the moment</span>. This also means that we often <span>neglect people next to us</span>.</p>
          <p>We designed this experience to make people feel <span>what it’s like to be ignored</span>, as you have experienced it yourself. So let’s recall a moment when you were talking to someone. <span>Were you actually listening?</span> Weren’t you just nodding but not really paying attention to the ‘message’ that he or she was trying to deliver?</p>
          <p>So here is what often happens in our day to day conversation with our parents, friends, and many more. While you are physically present, it does not always mean you are actually <span>‘present’</span> to have a conversation. How would this make the other person <span>feel</span>? How did you feel when this happened to you? Or, how did you feel when A and B excluded your opinion from choosing a restaurant? <span>We would like you to take a moment and reflect on yourself</span>.</p>
